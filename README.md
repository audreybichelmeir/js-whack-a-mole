# js-whack-a-mole

Followed a tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc&list=WL&index=40)
by Ania Kubow to create a whack-a-mole\
<br>
A simple base grid game, and the player needs to hit the grid with the mole as many times as possible before the timer runs out <br>

I learned vanilla Javascript:\
• querySelector()\
 • addEventListener()\
 • setInterval()\
 • classList\
 • forEach()\
 • Arrow functions
